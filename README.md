# OpenCell
The OSHS (Open Source Hardware/Software) cellphone project using FISHBONE.
FISHBONE, or F(OSS) Integrated System Hardware & Basic Operating & Network Enviroment, is a collection of hardware and software designed to create DIY experiences that prioritize user choice, privacy, and compatibility. FISHBONE consists of 'FISH', or open source hardware that integrates well with our software, known as BONE, the Basic Operating & Network Enviroment. BONE is a custom OS designed to support a wide array of custom hardware, facilitate the use of celleular, bluetooth, wifi,and mesh networks, and serve as an enviroment to test custom applications in.

This page serves as a guide for building your own OpenCell (or FishPhone) and provides the software neccessary to get it up and running.

The OpenCell V1 in it's most basic form will provide these features:
  Default;
    - Cellular calls via 4G physical SIM
    - SMS 'paging' and messaging
  Disabled by default;
    - Mesh networking
    - Mp3 playback
    - Custom app support
  Added via hardware and user apps;
    - Wifi
    - Bluetooth
    - GPS
    - Camera
    - Accelerometer
    - NFC/RFID
    - SDR (software defined radio)
    - IR blaster/sensor
    - USB OTG
    - USB HID
    - Custom displays
    - GPIO Support
    - Digital compass
    - METAR/TAF fetch
    - and more!
    
Will likely be based on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, perhaps with a custom daughterboard. Housing designed to be 3D printed but can be manufactured with your preferred method.
